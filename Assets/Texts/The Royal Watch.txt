The Royal Watch is a regulated militia of the Kingdom of Ustvar, with the explicit goal to protect its borders and to summon the regular Army should the need arise.

Founded by the Queen Lyra Redvers as a part of her strategy to consolidate the reconquered territories and protect the new frontiers of the Kingdom, the Watch is mainly composed by volunteers - men and women of all races and from all walks of life, and occasionally criminals who are given the choice between the noose or serving .


The Watchmen serve for a period of at least a year, being stationed to one of the many forts and towers built along the frontiers. All of the Watch’s facilities are equipped with a telescope, a heliograph and a emergency beacon - to be lit only in the most dire of situations - and a copy of the “Creed and Mission of Her Majesty`s Watchmen”, written by Arkhavast Pelegen, Knight Commander of the Watch, which reads as follows:

<i>“In the name of our illustrious majesty, Lyra Redvers - the Stern, first of her name, Lady of the lands and peoples of Ustvar - we, as members of the Royal Watch, have the duty and obligation of:

1-Maintain fealty to the Queen, to the House of Redvers and the Kingdom 

2-Defend the frontiers, subjects and possessions of the Kingdom from all threats, foreign or domestic

3-To be ever vigilant and alert the remaining of the Kingdom to any threat incapable of being contained by the Watch

4-Maintain the peace, rule of law and prosperity over all of the territories protected by the watch

5-Cooperate with the local nobility of the protected lands, for the good of our mission

6-Not abandoning our posts, the regions protected by the Watch and our duties to the kingdom, under punishment of imprisonment, Death or any other determined by the court martial

And so it shall be done, giving our lives if necessary. May the Gods help us. For the Queen, for Ustvar, for Glory!”</i>
