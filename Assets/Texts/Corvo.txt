<i>“I guarantee that you will come out lighter than you came in. I was talking about your wallet, but I believe your wounds will be at least smaller”</i> - Corvo 
    
Corvo was before all an entrepreneur. He began with simple scams, until he was taken under the wing of a teacher who saw in him the potential for medicine. After many years, the teacher began to resent Corvo and, fearing a betrayal, presented his apprentice with an opportunity to work in the Royal Watch and earn a significant amount of gold treating the sick and wounded.
The brilliance of money attracted his attention and, like a crow, and he joined up. Unbeknownst to Corvo however, the Watch offered minimum pay and maximum danger that he could no longer easily fly away.
