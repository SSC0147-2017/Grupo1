Entry #2
77th DAY OF SUMMER, 1560
   
The expedition team is composed of Master Hardaker, archeologist, natural philosopher and official leader of the group, his assistant Charlotte d'Auvergne (yours truly), arcanist Fiechter, Valdavar, an elf ranger from the forest realms of Cyamnos and our guide, and Grok - an orc of considerable prowess in battle (or so i’m told). We left Warynhurst at first light on the 75th day and headed North at a reasonable pace.
	
After two days of utterly exhausting travel, we reached Shiresburg, a bleak little town with no more than a thousand souls, located near the border with the Hastirian Empire and, most importantly, conveniently near to the ruins.
Valdavar, true to his solitary profession and background, asked us to stay in the Golden Boar, the local inn and our base of operations, whilst he reconnoitered the outskirts of the village in search of the ruins.

I, however, took the initiative and decided to interview the locals and gather information.  To my surprise, all whom I questioned gave the same directions for the place and all warned me against going. I also asked one of the royal watchmen stationed at the tower not far from the village, Thomas, I believe. He told me that some of his colleagues had entered the ruins and that they reported strange things; the layout of the corridors changing, strange noises, ancient statues.

I related my findings to master Hardaker, who told me he had prepared for such an obstacle and had Mr. Fiechter bring one of the University’s talismans. Fiechter explained that with it, he is able to stabilize time-space distortions and anomalies. Absolutely fascinating. 

We will begin our exploration tomorrow.
