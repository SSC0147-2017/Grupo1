Throughout Erelyn there are tales of things lurking in the dark and forgotten forests of the Savage Lands to the north of the Civilized realms. Of monsters in the shape of men, with eight eyes and six arms, that kill anyone foolish enough to enter their territory and occasionally feed on the livestock or even the loved ones of those near it.
