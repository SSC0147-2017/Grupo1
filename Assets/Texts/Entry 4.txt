Entry #4
80th DAY OF SUMMER, 1560

We spent the last days studying our initial findings, trying to make sense of what we found, to no avail. None of the books on ancient languages we brought makes reference to anything similar to the writings we found, Mr Fiechter’s mathematical analysis has also been unfruitful thus far.
One peculiar moment was when Grok gazed upon the sketches we made and uttered the word “Bugfolk”. I inquired him on what he meant by that, and confirmed my suspicions that he was indeed referring to the legends of the so-called Bugfolk. Although I could see how he was reminded of the myths - the figures in the carvings did in fact have 8 limbs - it clearly is a nonsensical theory.

First and foremost, there has not been recorded and verified evidence of the existence of the so-called Bugfolk, the disappearances linked to them can easily be attributed to other more grounded reasons and the accounts of the witnesses are most of the time so convoluted and discrepant that the only proof ascertainable is that the individual clearly had too much ale in his belly and too many horror tales in his head. I say this with the confidence of first hand experience for I had been attached as a scribe of a “Bugfolk attack” investigation two years prior.
And secondly, even if, for the sake of argument, they did exist, how the child-eating monsters who roam the woods could have any connection to the Ancient ones, who were civilized, well versed in the sciences and magics and left such a mysterious legacy, i cannot tell.

Being quite frank, I am somewhat disappointed at our friend Grok. Although I have no doubts regarding his martial prowess, the fact that he believes those rubbish stories makes me question his mental faculties.
