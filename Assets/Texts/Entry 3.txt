Entry #3
78th DAY OF SUMMER, 1560
    Today the first incursion was made, it was a truly singular experience. 
We entered the tunnels through the caverns in the forest and soon enough, we found ourselves in corridors carved in the stone before us. At first the details of the craftsmanship were obscured by the degrading action of time, however, as we advanced it became more evident that these were not a natural formation. Furthermore, the presence of carvings and ornaments along the walls and ceiling became noticeable. 
Signs of civilization. 

We reached a junction of corridors in a small room, illuminated by a blue stone on the ceiling. There, in the walls, we saw other symbols, more complex and intricate in design, etched in the stone. Upon closer inspection, it was possible to assess that the markings were made in a geometric fashion and presented repetition of symbols every so often. The conclusion was obvious: writings!
If these ruins were indeed built by the ancients, this is the first ever recorded finding of their written language and we had the privilege to discover them. We stood there for three or maybe four hours, copying every symbol and phrase we could and after that we continued forward, marking our path with magic chalk. 

Sensing something, Mr. Fiechter made the strong suggestion for us to return to the surface and Master Hardaker decided to comply. Fortunately no spatial reconfiguration occurred and so the talisman continued to go unused. 
	
Part of me wanted to continue the exploration, but the task of studying and unraveling the mysterious ciphers are exciting too. By the gods, what could those mean? What were they trying to say?
