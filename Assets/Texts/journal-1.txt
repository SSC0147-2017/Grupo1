Entry #1
72th DAY OF SUMMER, 1560
    Finally! After several weeks of much haggling, explaining and a fierce fight with bureaucracy, the academic council secured the funding, and the Baron’s blessing, for the Urlyn expedition. Master Hardaker is positively ecstatic with the news. With the writing of these pages, I shall begin to write the record of our voyage and findings. 
Ever since the beginning of the summer, reports and rumors of the opening of ruins below the Urlyn valley have spread like wildfire, tales of ancient halls, treasures, etc. etc. Whilst they are most certainly filled with peasant nonsense, master Hardaker had in his possession a tome which corroborated the existence of structures of the Ancients in the region. And thus began the story of our expedition.
Who’s to tell what wonders await Master Hardaker, Fiechter and I ? Hopefully we can expand our insights on the Ancients and their society, history, magic… bring rain to the oasis of knowledge surrounded by a desert of legends and myths.
Philosophy aside, we begin preparations today, and are scheduled to leave in three days time. I cannot contain my excitement!
