<i>“A King forces thousands to fight for his interests. A pirate inspires millions to search for freedom”</i> - Jackie

Son of artisans, Jackie was in love with the sea since a child. This made his father nurture the idea of sending him to the Navy, where he would probably become a hero. However, as the boy grew, the life of a pirate interested him more and more. When he became 16, he ran from home and went to live in the colorless ships, but this life would not last long. Despite becoming the captain of his own crew, he was arrested at age 20 and sentenced to death. After some bartering, he managed to be “volunteered” for the Royal Watch as an alternate sentence.
