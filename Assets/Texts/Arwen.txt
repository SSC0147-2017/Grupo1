<i>”A life without loyalty is empty, but for loyalty I have taken lives less empty than mine”</i> - Arwen

Arwen is an elf with shadow manipulation powers, a strange ability in the midst of her kind and the reason for her being treated as a stranger in her village. One day, king Ander Redvers II came and offered her a way out of her miserable life in the village. He saw her power as a gift instead of a curse and took her to the capital. There she was trained as a Royal Assassin, with the role of protecting the kingdom from the evils of darkness. After the death of the King, doubting the queen as a worthy successor, she decided to serve Ustvar in the frontiers. Even so, she remains alert to the new reign.
