Entry #7
84th? DAY OF SUMMER, 1560

The master has accomplished a tremendous task by maintaining both me and Grok away from complete panic and desperation. I have no idea how he does it, but he remains steadfast in such a ghastly situation.
Yesterday (has it been a day already?) we performed an impromptu … autopsy, of sorts, in the thing that the orc had killed, or what was left of it, while Grok regained his nerves. It was almost two meters in height and had eight limbs, six of them arms, and two of those very much like our own. Its skin was very reminiscent of the chitinous plaques of an arachnid, however it still had an endoskeleton.
   
Its head was asymmetrical, similar to the statues in one side, but the other was partially bursted from the inside, from where orange growths spurted out. The growths seemed to be organic in nature but far from anything that I, or the Master for that matter, had ever seen. They did not seem to be a natural (if such a word can even be used in this case) part of the body, and he suggested it might be an infection or parasite of some sort.

We whispered between ourselves so not to distress Grok. I suggested that, if the growths were indeed a disease, it might have been the reason why the Ancients vanished from our world. The Master agreed with my assessment. If what little the orc could articulate of what had happened was correct, the thing’s animalistic behaviour seemed to be at odds with the amount of knowledge and civilization it would take to build all of this. Perhaps the infection made them feral, but I cannot tell for sure.

Grok was right, the Bugfolk are real. We must find a way out, we must warn the Kingdom.
