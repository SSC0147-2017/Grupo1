The Kingdom of Ustvar is a highly centralized monarchy in Erelyn, ruled by Queen Lyra of the house of Redvers. It is famous for its blend of old traditions, such as a nobles and knights, and new ideas, like the equality of all subjects under the law and a scientific approach to magic.
	
Founded 450 years ago by the unification of three smaller kingdoms under the leadership of Rutgarr Silver Lion. Ustvar spent most of its first century growing from a small backwater kingdom to a rich and mighty power in the Civilized world. Eventually, the Kingdom became bitter rivals with the other great power, the Hastirian Empire, over riches and lands. 
  
The Kingdom entered in crisis 150 ago due to a series of weak and incompetent kings, several Plagues, two civil wars and economic bankruptcy. The power of the monarchs was no longer felt, and many regions were lost to anarchy or annexation by other kingdoms. However, Ander Redvers II, The Great, managed to bring Ustvar from the brink of death. With his legendary cavalry, the Silver Lions, and his unprecedented political skills,  Ander reforged the Kingdom into a much more centralized and modern nation, reconquering lost provinces and glory.
	
Now his daughter, Lyra Redvers , the Stern faces the challenge of consolidating the new territories and protecting her subjects from the encroaching Hastirians, the savages beyond the mountains and separatists in the frontiers.
