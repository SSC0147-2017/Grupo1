The oldest and largest nation in Erelyn, the Hastirian Empire is currently ruled by Shonor XII. 

Its history dates back more than a thousand years ago, to the old city of Hastiria, when  Arnasheer the Everseeing took power and became the first Empress, leading an extremely powerful  cabal of mages, who would become the first Conclave. Before dying, Arnasheer made into law that all future Emperors would be elected by the Conclave of Magi once every 2482 days.

With their prowess in the arcane arts and alchemy -being the first ones to discover and use gunpowder to its fullest potential - the Empire conquered and enslaved hundreds of nations and peoples, securing dominion over much of the known world.

It was inevitable that hubris and decadence would befall such a powerful and rich nation. For the last 300 years the empire has been in a constant state of decline: its nobles murdering themselves over petty issues, provinces rising up against centuries of tyranny, its mages seeking new powers in dark places and its government becoming corrupt and inefficient. It was in this period that Hastiria and Ustvar became bitter rivals, fighting several wars over lands, riches and glory.

Even in this decadent state, the Hastirian Empire endures, a lumbering behemoth falling apart one piece at a time, its influence still felt throughout the lands and its power still feared by many.
