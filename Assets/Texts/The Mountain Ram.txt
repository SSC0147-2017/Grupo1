    Folklore of the Urlyn Valley tells of a supernatural entity that inhabits the mountain passes, north of the river. The Mountain Ram, named after its physical form, has its origins and true nature shrouded in mystery. Travelers told of ram, unnaturally large for its size, with bone white horns, ominously stalking them on the mountain trails. No one could tell from where it came, only that it would disappear as suddenly as it had come within sight.
	
    According to several sources however, if the Ram appeared in one’s path, one of the following would happen: It would either charge with impossible speed and strength, utterly destroying any and all unable to quickly escape. Or it would allow the travelers to head back, attacking only if they tried to continue forward. And there are those who speak that the Ram would demand tribute to allow safe passage, and that an extremely intricate and bizarre ritual involving a live animal, some worldly luxury and the ashes of something innocent.
    The lack of consensus regarding the Ram’s true nature and intentions has greatly contributed to its fearsome reputation, driving away many of the locals
