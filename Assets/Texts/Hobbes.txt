<i>“There’s nothing nor no one that can’t be solved with some good hammering” </i>- Hobbes

A former slave, Hobbes was adopted by an old master blacksmith who taught him everything he knew. When his master passed away, Hobbes went in search of a job, somewhere that would make use of his skills without asking many question, and thought of the Royal Watch as a good opportunity.  

Through a mix of skill in problem solving and some coincidences, Hobbes would be promoted to the rank of Tower Officer.
