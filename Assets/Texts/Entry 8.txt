Entry #8
    ?? DAY OF SUMMER, 1560
I am alone now.

We spent the last days wandering aimlessly through the ruins, occasionally fighting off the Bugfolk. Despair began to take over us as our supplies ran short by the hour, and the threat of starvation and thirst began to outweigh being mauled to death.

When we saw a small camp in a room, with boxes of food and barrels of water it felt like a miracle, as if the gods would deliver us from this nightmare. The fact that they were probably left behind by adventurers who never escaped this place alive did not cross our minds. 

We sat there for a brief moment until the clatter of a hundred feet came from the corridor in front of the camp. From the darkness came a swarm of humanoid things, shrieking terrifyingly in union, a chorus from hell. They probably were another race or caste of bugfolk, no taller than a child, with pincers for hands and odiously large red eyes that faintly shone in the shadows.

Grok and the Master tried to fight them off, killing individual ones with ease, but for each that fell it seemed as if five others came from the shadows to take its place. Master Hardaker was overwhelmed and dragged down to the floor. By the gods, his screams were terrible.... 
The Orc began to flee and so did I. I ran, and ran like a madwoman, without thought or hesitation I entered the dark hallways. Only after utter exhaustion took over my muscles and falling face down had I realized that Grok was not with me. I cannot tell where he went, or where we split up. 

I don’t think I’ll be able to find him.

I don’t want to die here.
