The Urlyn Valley is a region reconquered by Ustvar seven years ago and now is part of the lands of the barony of Waryn, in the northern frontier. It forms a salient between the Hastirian Empire to the East and the Savage lands, to the north and west. 

With a population of around 2000 souls, most of them inhabiting the town of Shiresburg, and a predominantly agrarian economy, the Valley is quiet and idyllic most part, occasionally crossed by travellers and merchants wishing to shorten their path to the Empire or the eastern parts of the Kingdom.

There are two things of note on the Valley however: the Watchtower #1104, recently occupied by a rather peculiar group of watchmen, and the colossal and mysterious complex of underground ruins that defy time, space, logic and all that is holy in this world.
